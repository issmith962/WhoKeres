					Paul Keres (January 7, 1916 – June 5, 1975) was an Estonian-Soviet chess player and writer. He was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s and in 1950, was awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE on its inaugural list.
					</p>
					<p>
					Keres narrowly missed a chance at a world championship match on five occasions. He won the 1938 AVRO tournament, which led to negotiations for a title match against champion Alexander Alekhine, but the match never took place due to World War II. After the war Keres was runner-up in the Candidates' Tournament on four consecutive occasions.
					</p>
					<p>
					Due to these and other strong results, many chess historians consider Keres one of the greatest players in history, and the strongest player never to become world champion. He was nicknamed "Paul the Second", "The Eternal Second" and "The Crown Prince of Chess". Keres, Viktor Korchnoi and Alexander Beliavsky defeated nine world champions—more than anyone else in history.	
					</p>
					<p>
					His rival Samuel Reshevsky said that Keres failed to become world champion because he lacked a killer instinct and "was too mild a person to give his all in order to defeat his opponents. He took everything, including his chess, philosophically. Keres is one of the nicest people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. With his friendly and sincere smile, he makes friends easily. He is goodnatured and kind. Yes, he loves chess, but being a human being is his first consideration. In addition to chess, Keres was interested in tennis, Ping-Pong, swimming, and bridge."
